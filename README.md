# This is my LeetCode Diary.

 For the first time when I start studying LeetCode, it was so hard to fully understand.

 I hope my diary could help people who needs a little help and for those who are in the same situation like me.

 Let's not give up. I am here too :)

 /*To study well, do not just jump into LeetCode problems. You should check what you do not know and what you do. Try to recap what you have learned from school like data structure and algorithm first.*/
